# Overview

Solidus's flexibility allows changing every part of the store, both the
storefront part (also called frontend) and the admin panel (also
called backend).

There are different levels of customizations, some of them are very easy to
implement, even for inexperienced developers, others may require a solid
understanding of the Ruby and Ruby on Rails ecosystem, which are the language
and the framework that power Solidus, respectively.
